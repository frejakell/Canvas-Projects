Just for fun! Here are three different Canvas project with no real purpose. "Falling" creats a network of strings when you move the mouse over the page.
The network collapses and falls immediately and the strings disappears when they touch the bottom.

The "Shapes" project is a prototype of a drawing software that lets you create a series of shapes with dynamic colour, outline, angle off-set and more. 
It works but for the time being it is not very user friendly or elegant.
