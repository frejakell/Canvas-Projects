# Canvas-Projects
Just for fun! Here are two different Canvas project with no real purpose. "Falling" creats a network of strings when you move the mouse over the page.
The network collapses and falls immediately and the strings disappears when they touch the bottom.

The shapes project is a prototype of a drawing software that lets you create a series of shapes with dynamic colour, outline, angle off-set and more. 
It works but for the time being it is not very user friendly or elegant.
